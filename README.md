# InvestigateDataset
Udacity Project - Investigate a Dataset
This was a project as part of the Udacity Nanodegree for Data Analytics

For this project, I analyzed no-show appointment data from Kaggle comprised of information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil for 2016.  I attempted to determine if there were any factors that would help predict a patients propensity to fail to show up for their scheduled appointment. Key columns from the dataset include;
  Neighborhood: the location of the hospital for the appointment
  Scholarship: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in the Brasilian welfare program
  Ailments: indicates whether or not the patient has any specific ailments
  No-Show: indicates if the customer showed up for thier appointment or not
