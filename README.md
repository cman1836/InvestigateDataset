# InvestigateDataset
Udacity Project - Investigate a Dataset
This was a project as part of the Udacity Nanodegree for Data Analytics

For this project, I will be analyzing no-show appointment data from Kaggle, looking to determine if there are any factors that can predict a patients propensity to fail to show up for their scheduled appointment. This data set is comprised of information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil for 2016. Key columns include;

Neighborhood: the location of the hospital for the appointment
Scholarship: indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in the Brasilian welfare program
Ailments: indicates whether or not the patient has any specific ailments
No-Show: indicates if the customer showed up for thier appointment or not
